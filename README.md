- 👋 Hi, I’m @oscar139 or Alex
- 👀 I’m interested in ... It would be easier to list the things that don't interest me. Four years ago I became interested in machining because of [click spring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU7iKNmQBIs). **Seriously check out Click Spring it is worth your time.** I managed to find an opportunity to become a CNC Machinist and I took it. Circumstances have changed and I am not able to pursue it as a career I am pivoting back to software. I am still interested in machining as a hobby. I just have to figure out how to fit/wire up a lathe and mill in the basement.

- 💞️ Any opportunity to work on something meaningful while narrowing down my interests would be greatly appreciated.
