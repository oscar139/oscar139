- 👋 Hi, I’m @oscar139 or Alex
- 👀 I’m interested in ... It would be easier to list the things that don't interest me like dirt. Actually dirt is fascinating and I could easily talk about it for an hour or more. Four years ago I became interested in machining because of [click spring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU7iKNmQBIs). **Seriously check out Click Spring it is worth your time.** I managed to find an opportunity to become a CNC Machinist and I took it. Circumstances have changed and I am not able to pursue it as a career and as of December 2021 am pivoting back to software. I am still interested in machining as a hobby. I just have to figure out how to fit/wire up a lathe and mill in the basement.    
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything that Free Code Camp has to offer. Data Analysis with Python has been most exciting. And I am really enjoying the learning structure. I am rebuilding my knowledge and updating my skills. There is programming and computer skills to be used in CNC machining but there isn't much need for pointers, objects, arrays, and the like.      
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything for someone relatively new. Any opportunity to work on something meaningful while narrowing down my interests would be greatly appreciated.
